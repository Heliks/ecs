- Node 14

Install pnpm if it is not already installed on your system:

```

```

## Publish

1. Setup project for development
2. Log into repository in which packages should be published.
3. Adjust versions in packages that should be published.
4. Run the `publish` script. It should take care of everything else.

```shell

are ready to be published.
